    "# Diabetes Risk Prediction\n",
    "This project uses the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey data from [this link](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2024.html) to predict the probability of developing different types of Diabetes. Features about U.S. residents include demographic data (e.g. income level, education, race) as well as data regarding health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **second notebook** for the project, which reads the dataframe created by the `parse_raw_data.ipynb` notebook, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and develops a predictive model for assessing Diabetes risk. If all goes well, I will try to add multiclass prediction to include Prediabetes risk. The primary target variable for this study will be the DIABETE4 column in the dataframe (i.e. \"(Ever told) you had diabetes\"), which includes Prediabetes as a separate class. This dataset is highly imbalanced so will require additional effort to train the model effectively. Note that the other two Diabetes related columns (PREDIAB2 and DIABTYPE) have been included for validation purposes, and for potential future study.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 26 candidate features included in the input dataframe. EDA and modeling evaluation will likely reduce this number. The final columns used for the predictive model will be listed here when they have been selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The input dataset contains 2 identifier columns, 3 Target variable candidates and a total of 26 potential features. Each column name is provided below with their column name in the dataframe (i.e. SAS variable name and their human-readable label from the HTML file)\n",
